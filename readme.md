## Usage
* Clone this repository.
* Make sure you have the `stdc++.h` header file in your header files directory. You can download the file [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gcc-mirror/gcc/master/libstdc%2B%2B-v3/include/precompiled/stdc%2B%2B.h). 
    * The `stdc++.h` header file includes every `stl` library and its use is encouraged for educational/testing purposes only.
    * Make sure to setup your terminal and editor to include the correct header file. I have used VSCode with `clang++`. The directory (on Mac) for header files is at `/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/include/c++/v1`
* Navigate to the directory of the problem you want to solve. The list of problems can be found below
* The following commands can be used to compile the code:
    * #### clang++: `clang++ -std=c++14 <filename>.cpp`
    * #### g++: `g++ -std=c++14 <filename>.cpp`
* View the output by running `./a.out`

### How to write code for new problems

There is a simple script ```newCode.sh``` that will set up a new directory and initialise the ```readme.md``` and ```.cpp``` files for you. 

Run the following code in the root directory of the project and answer the prompt and viola!*
```
sh newCode.sh
``` 
**Requires python3 to be installed on your system*
